# Project2023
# Project to experience and learn Automation Testing
This project we aim to gain experience with day to day working as a tester which includes working on Git hub and getting hands on experience on Java intelliJ, by creating a BDD Framework in a Maven Project.
## In this README, we will highlight the following steps for project creation:
* Getting Started with the essentials.
* Create a Git hub Account.
* Create a New Maven Project and link with the Cloned Repository.
* Create Project Dependencies in POM.xml.
* Create BDD Framework in the maven project.
* Create Read me File in the Git Repository.
 
 # Getting Started with the essentials
Before we start, it is essential that we install the below-
* Git Hub
* Git on Windows/mac
* IntelliJ & Java JDK

# Create a Git hub Account
We start by creating a Git hub account and linking it with the Git repository in our local PC. we have selected to save it in the same folder where our Intelli J Projects are saved. we use Git bash or Terminal to check status , add files from local git repository to Git hub, commit , push and many more. used these functions to successfully clone Gib hub repository in my local PC.

# Create a New Maven Project and link with the Cloned Repository
We continue by creating a new project in IntelliJ named "NewProjectAug2023" . and link it with the clone repository on our local Pc in the folder that is linked with Git hub

# Create Project Dependencies in POM.xml
Project Dependencies is a concept in which the objects get other required objects from outside. We add dependencies in our project by adding it in POM.XML. We get the required dependencies to be added in our project from "https://mvnrepository.com/" . At most times we select the latest version of the dependency

# Create BDD Framework in the maven project
Next would be adding new packages named Browser control, Features, Page Objects, Step definitions & Utilities as a part of your BDD Framework

# Create Read me File in the Git Repository
The final step for this project was to work on the ReadMe file.
